1. Stackoverflow | [Link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19816275/no-acceptable-c-compiler-found-in-path-when-installing-python) | Encountered compilation errors during the installation of Python, I identified the issue as a missing GCC compiler. The command **'sudo apt-get install build-essential'** resolves this problem by installing essential development tools and libraries, including GCC. This ensures the availability of necessary components for compiling and building software on a Linux system.
